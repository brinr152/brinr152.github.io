					At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity's basic mysteries -- the origin of the Library and of time -- might be found.  
				</span>
				<span id="line2light">
					It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the unprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars.
				</span>
				<span id="line3light">
					For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons ... There are official searchers, inquisitors.
				</span>
				<span id="line4light">
					I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words.
				</span>
				<span id="line5light">
					Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.
				</span></p>
				<p><span id="line6light">
					As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression.
				</span>
				<span id="line7light">
					The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. 
				</span>
				<span id="line8light">
					A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books.
				</span>
				<span id="line9light">
					The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders.  
				</span>
				<span id="line10light">
					The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder. 
				</span></p>
				<p><span id="line11light">
					Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. 
				</span>
				<span id="line12light">
					They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books.
				</span>
				<span id="line13light">
					Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts.
				</span>
				<span id="line14light">
					One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal.  
				</span>
				<span id="line15light">
					The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma.   
				</span>
				<span id="line16light">
					Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. 
				</span>
				<span id="line17light">
					They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical.
